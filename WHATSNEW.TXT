Version 0.97c:

  + Fixed bug with reading the 8254 timer; should no longer get
    results like "65535 or "54xxx" for the timings

Version 0.97b:

  - Removed attempts to detect 80c8x processors because it is not
    possible to differentiate between an 80c8x and a 1981-or-later 808x
  - Removed attempts to differentiate between an AMD 386 and an Intel 386
    because it is unknown when the UMOV instruction was added and removed
    from various CPUs

Version 0.97:

  + Stub now appends to output file instead of overwriting it.
  + Command-line options added to optinally skip dodgy detection routines,
    add a system description, and change the output filename.

Version 0.96:

  * Added two compilation targets, one normal and one for debugging (dstub).
    Either one can be run to gather output, although only dstub will produce
    errors that the author can use to debug problems.
  + Fixed bug with Cirrus Logic detection (was trying to write a word value
    to a byte-sized port)

Version 0.95:

  - BIOS CRC routine was overzealous.  Now only the area from the BIOS
    init vector to FFFFF is scanned.
  + VirtualBox and PC Transporter added to detection library.

Version 0.94:

  + Added detection for AT&T PC 6300, Olivetti M24, and Compaq Portable III
    extended CGA 640x400 adapters.
  + Added machine model word to the output, to help expand the detection
    database.
  + Rewrote BIOS identification from HLL to assembler and brought the
    execution time from ~24 seconds down to 0.5 on 8088 :-D
  + Identified stack overflows and fixed them (whoops).  Compatibility
    should rise because of this.
  - Extra handling of floppy support added so the floppy access wouldn't
    affect the CPU MHz calc.  RAM usage up 3K as a result.
  * topbench source currently at 5700 lines.

Version 0.93:

  + Changed all text output to go through DOS for compatibility and a
    slight size reduction.
  - Removed attempts to detect 80C88 and 80C86 CPUs since they were causing
    false positives.
