                        The Zen Timer Library
                        =====================

                            Version 1.1

Turbo Pascal Notes
------------------

   Duncan Murdoch kindly took the time to build a Turbo Pascal interface
for the Zen Timer library, which requires Turbo Pascal 6.0 or above (so
he tells me :-). Following are his notes on the interface unit.

   The interface to the assembler routines is written to be as simple as
possible.  Void functions became procedures; the count functions returning
unsigned long integers return signed longints.  Leading underscores were added
to the procedure/function names to match the assembler source.

   Because of limitations in the linker, TP versions prior to 6.0 will
*not* be able to use this unit.

Interfaced routines:

procedure _PZTimerOn;              Starts precision timer.

procedure _PZTimerOff;             Stops precision timer.

procedure _PZTimerReport;          Reports result of precision timing to
                                   standard output.

function  _PZTimerCount : longint; Returns microsecond count for precision
                                   timer.  May overflow, and return negative
                                   value.  Value -1 signals timer overflow.

procedure _LZTimerOn;              The LZ routines are as above, but for
procedure _LZTimerOff;             the long period timer.
procedure _LZTimerReport;
function  _LZTimerCount : longint;

   I have asked Duncan if it is possible for Turbo Pascal to handle 
unsigned long integers, since times greater than about 35 minutes will 
become negative when interpreted as a signed long integer. If this is not
possible, then you will have to take this into account when using the
library.

   Please note that as in this version the Turbo Pascal related code does
not include the ultra long period timing routines and does not have the
advantage of the C++ class interface (naturally :-) as I don't have
Turbo Pascal and have not ported the changes.
