                       -----------------------

                           Revision History
                          ------------------

Version 1.0 - Jan 1992
----------------------

    Original version of the library including the port by Duncan Murdoch
for Turbo Pascal 6.0 users.

Version 1.1 - April 1992
------------------------

  - Modified the long period Zen Timer to allow timing across the midnight
    boundary.

  - Added a new Ultra Long period timer for timing code that takes up to
    24 hours to execute.

  - Added a new common C++ class interface to the Zen Timer library
    to abstract out the differences between the old timer routines and the
    new ultra long period routines.

  - Because of the addition of C++ wrapper classes etc had to make the
    library memory model dependant again.
