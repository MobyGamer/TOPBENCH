This is the benchmarking and system detection stub of TOPBENCH.  This stub was
created so that 128KB systems without the ability to run the complete benchmark
tool could still identified and benchmarked.  This stub will attempt to
identify your system and video adapter, benchmark various aspects of your
system, and then write the information to an output file which can then be
imported into the full benchmark tool, or emailed to trixter@oldskool.org to
help seed TOPBENCH's internal database.

Run with "-?" for additional command-line options.$
