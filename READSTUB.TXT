Thanks for offering to help with the development of TOPBENCH!
This archive contains the following:

topbstub.exe - The TOPBENCH profiling and detection stub.
               Requires ~56K free RAM.

topbstub.ovr - Overlay code for topbstub

dstub.exe    - A "debug" version of the stub, in case topbstub
               does not run properly.  No code is overlaid, it has
               additional redundant safety checks, and more errors are
               reported. Requires 96K free RAM.

dstub.map    - A full segment and symbolic listing for topdstub.  If
               dstub produces an error, the segment:offset can be looked
               up in the .map to find the source of the problem.

Both programs take optional arguments; use -? to get command-line usage.

If dstub craps out on your system, please send me the details and I'll
do my best to fix it.
